Batavia
=======

Tools to run Python bytecode in the browser.

This is experimental code. If it breaks, you get to keep all the shiny pieces.

What it does:

* Unmarshals Base64 encoded bytecode into Code objects

* Implements most of the common Python VM opcodes

What it doesn't do:

* Make a good distinction between integer and floating point math

* Any attempt at unicode handling.

Quickstart
----------

The `testserver` directory contains a minimal Django project that will serve
Python bytecode to your browser and execute it. To run this project, install
Django 1.8 into your virtual environment with Python 3.4; then, at a shell prompt::

    $ cd testserver
    $ ./manage.py runserver

You can then load http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your browser. When the page loads,
you will see a set of buttons corresponding to Python modules that
have been embedded in the page:

* The PyStone performance benchmark. The Python bytecode is embedded as a
  string in the HTML file.

* `sample.py`, a simple Python example demonstrating basic VM features.
   The PYC content that is dynamically generated on the server and served
   to the client. This file imports a second file, `other.py`, to
   demonstrate how imports work.

Click one of the buttons, and the code will run; stdout/stderr has been
redirected to the webpage, so if the script has any output, you'll see it.

To start tinkering, make changes to `testserver/sample.py`, reload the page,
and click the button.
