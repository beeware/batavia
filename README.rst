Batavia
=======

**Batavia is an early alpha project. If it breaks, you get to keep all the shiny pieces.**

Batavia is an implementation of the Python virtual machine, written in
Javascript. It enables you to run Python bytecode in the browser.

It honors Python 3.4.4 syntax and conventions, but also provides the ability to
reference objects and classes defined natively in JavaScript.

Tutorial

To take Batavia for a spin, run through the `Getting Started guide`_, then start
with `the first tutorial`_.

Why "Batavia?"
--------------

On 27 October, 1628, *Commandeur* Francisco Pelsaert took command of the
*Batavia*, and with 340 passengers and crew, set sail from Texel. Their
destination? The Spice Islands - or more specifically, island of Java in the
Dutch East Indies (now part of Indonesia).

The Batavia was... a Java ship (rimshot!).

Interestingly, during the voyage, Ariaen Jacobsz and *onderkoopman* Jeronimus
Cornelisz incited a mutiny, because they didn't want to go to Java - they
wanted to escape to start a new life somewhere else. As a result of the
mutiny, on 4 June 1629, the Batavia ran aground on Morning Reef, part of the
Houtman Abrolhos, about 450km North of Perth, Western Australia, where this
project was conceived.

The `full story of the Batavia`_ is known to most Western Australian
schoolchildren, and is a harrowing tale of intrigue, savagery, and murder. It
serves as a reminder of what can happen when you force people to go to Java
:-)

The wreck of the Batavia was recovered in the 1970s, and now stands in the
`shipwrecks gallery of the Western Australian Maritime Museum`_.
