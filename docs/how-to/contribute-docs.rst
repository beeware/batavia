Contributing to the documentation
=================================

Here are some tips for working on this documentation. You're welcome to add more and help us out!

First of all, you should check the `Restructured Text (reST) and Sphinx
CheatSheet <http://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_ to learn how to write your .rst file.

To create a .rst file
---------------------
Look at the structure and choose the best category to put your .rst file. Make sure that it is referenced in
the index of the corresponding category, so it will show on in the documentation. If you have no idea how
to do this, study the other index files for clues.


To build locally on GNU/Linux and open it on the browser:
---------------------------------------------------------

Go to the documentation folder: ::

    $ cd docs

Install Sphinx with the helpers and extensions we use: ::

    $ pip install -r requirements_docs.txt

Create the static files: ::

    $ make html

Check for any errors and,if possible, fix them.
The output of the file should be in the ``_build/html`` folder.
Open the file you changed in the browser.
