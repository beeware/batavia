**Batavia is an early alpha project. If it breaks, you get to keep all the shiny pieces.**

Batavia is an implementation of the Python virtual machine, written in
JavaScript. It enables you to run Python bytecode in the browser.

It honors Python 3.4 syntax and conventions, but also provides the ability to
reference objects and classes defined natively in JavaScript.
