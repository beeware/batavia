Limitations
===============

There are high level issues with the incompatibility of some low level Python fundamental functionality
that do not exist in JavaScript. 

These issues are detailed here. 

id
---

"Return the identity of an object.
This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects.
(CPython uses the object's memory address.)"

This doesn't exist in JavaScript. There's no useful information that can be returned from `id` in this instance.
