Clickjacking Protection Middleware.

This module provides a middleware that implements protection against a

    Middleware that sets the X-Frame-Options HTTP header in HTTP responses.

    Does not set the header if it's already set or if the response contains
    a xframe_options_exempt value set to True.

    By default, sets the X-Frame-Options header to 'SAMEORIGIN', meaning the
    response can only be loaded on a frame within the same site. To prevent the
    response from being loaded in a frame in any site, set X_FRAME_OPTIONS in
    your project's Django settings to 'DENY'.

    Note: older browsers will quietly ignore this header, thus other
    clickjacking protection techniques should be used if protection in those
    browsers is required.
